# ptxtwiki
Very simple plain text static client side Javascript personal wiki

This is intended to somewhat look like the Palm OS Memo Pad app, with inspiration from [PalmWiki](https://wiki.pitecan.com/PalmWiki/index_e.html). It's not intended to have many features beyond the four types of links (examples in index file):
* http:// raw text external
* Markdown style square [name] and round (url) brackets external
* CamelCase wiki style internal
* Single square bracket internal

This is not bug free and it is very quirky, over time I may change the text file format to have multiple pages in a single file, in line with the export output from [J-Pilot](https://www.jpilot.org/). I have a few goals:
* Keep the code and main web page very simple
* Static files
* Parse text files (or one text file with all pages)
* Sharable links to pages
* "Responsive" CSS so the reader can get the same experience on many devices

For now I have released this as Creative Commons Zero, so do with this as you wish.
